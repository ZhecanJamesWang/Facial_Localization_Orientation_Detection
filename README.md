# Facial_Localization_Orientation_Detection
This is preparation for the 2nd Facial Landmark Localisation Competition - The Menpo BenchMark
https://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/resources/2nd-facial-landmark-tracking-competition-menpo-ben/
This repo implements a faical bounding box refinement model to better localize the face in photos.
This helps the facial detection model in our pipeline to better detect facial key points during the competition.
